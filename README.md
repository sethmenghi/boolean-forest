###Project Description: 

For this assignment, you will create software for the social good.  This project will be completed in groups and will use software engineering design methodology.  Your group will developsoftware that has a clear benefit to society / education.  The final software should be a Java applet. You will also have a website that explains how to use the software and a discussion of the social benefit

###Assignment Breakdown:
For this assignment, you will need to develop an application that has a clear social benefit.  You will use git.hub to share code. Your group will begin by brainstorming and identifying a social problem and a solution (that is doable) to the problem. Along with the application, you will develop use case scenarios, an activity diagram, a class diagram, sequence diagram, and a user interface storyboard. The application can be designed as your group sees fit.  However, it must have the following features:

1. A clear explanation of how to use the software.
2. A modular design.
3. One inteface.
4. An intuitive graphical user interface.
5. A clear set of tasks.
6. Unit tests
7. A usability study (3 users) done after the prototype, an explanation of changes made based on the usability study, a final usability study (3 users).

###Milestones
1. Software textual description (problem statement), use case(s), class diagram, sequence diagram, activitydiagram, storyboard(10%)
2. Prototype of software (5%)
3. Presentation of software (5%)
4. Final software + usability study (75% + 5% group evaluation)
